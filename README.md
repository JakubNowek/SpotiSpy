# SpotiSpy

### What is SpotiSpy?

It is an app **(currently a script)** that enables you to monitor artist that you follow on Spotify. 

### Use Case:
You recently followed 10 new artists and don't know if they are listen-worthy. Best way to know that is to listen to their music,
and in case you like it, add it to your playlist. Now how will you listen to it? Will you go to each artist and wear off your ears,
listening to the whole discography at once, eventually getting bored, and then go to another artist, and another, and... another?

Second option which  will prevent you from getting bored and keep the diversity of music styles and genres, would be to create
a playlist to which you will add whole discography of all 10 artists and then listen to it in shuffle mode. Well yes, for me, it's 
more compelling, but if you know Spotify well enough, you know that there is no option allowing you to add all tracks of an artist
to your playlist using just one button... which means you need to go to each artist, to each album/single/whatever and add it manually
one by one. 

Tiring, isn't it? And how boring and time-consuming. It is tedious enough with 10 artists, and how about 20? or 100?

Here comes my app.

### How does it work?

[//]: # (First use &#40;ideally before you start adding new artists&#41;: )
1. Get a list of followed artists.
2. Create a playlist, that you want to add new tracks to (you can also use existing).
3. Follow as many artists as you want.
4. Get a list of followed artists again and calculate the difference - that is a list of newly added artists.
5. Add all tracks of all the newly added artists to your playlist.
